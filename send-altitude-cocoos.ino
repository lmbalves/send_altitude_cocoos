#include <Arduino.h>
#include <SPI.h>  //  Needed by BME280 library.

//  Where's the code? Look in main.cpp.
//  Note: setup() and loop() will not be called since main() 
//  is defined (in main.cpp)

//  If you wish, you may use this file as a staging area while
//  porting your Arduino code to .h and .cpp files. That's how
//  bme.h and bme.cpp were created.
