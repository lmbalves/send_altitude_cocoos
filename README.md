Arduino sketch to read BME280 temperature, humidity and altitude sensors and process the data concurrently.  Multitasking of the sensors
is handled by cocoOS, the portable scheduling task framework: http://www.cocoos.net

Libraries needed to compile with Arduino IDE or Arduino Web Editor:

- `Time`: Download `Time` from Arduino Library Manager

- `BME280`: Download `BME280` from Arduino Library Manager

- `cocoOS_5.0.1`: Download from http://www.cocoos.net/download.html, 
    unzip and move all files in `inc` and `src` to top level.
    Zip up and add to Arduino IDE as library.

Tested with Arduino Uno.
